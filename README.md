A few useful Minecraft plugins for server admins.

## Note

Voxowl is the developer of [Particubes](https://particubes.com), a place to hangout, play and build anything with cubes. It is in fact an alternative to Minecraft. We started to work on this project for different reasons, but we still love playing Minecraft. ðŸ™‚

We recently started a new server for the COVID quarantine, and ended up with more than 300 registered players! ðŸ˜„

It's a [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server, and we're using a few [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugins to improve the experience.

We wrote some of these plugins and decided to open source them. They could be useful for your own server.
